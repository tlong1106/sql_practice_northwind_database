-- Updating, Deleting Data (Use CTEs to preserve original data if needed):
--- UPDATE: Increase the unit price of all products in the "Beverages" category by 10%.

--- DELETE: Delete all records from the orders table where the order date is before January 1, 1997.

-- Data Types:
--- Create a new table ArchivedOrders with appropriate data types based on selected columns from the orders table. Include ---- an archive date (DATE type) that defaults to CURRENT_DATE.



-- Aliasing:
--- Retrieve product names and their total quantity sold. Use clear table and column aliases to make the query readable.

SELECT
  p.product_name,
  SUM(od.quantity) AS quantity_sold
FROM products AS p
JOIN order_details AS od
  ON p.product_id = od.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name

-- Creating Views:
--- Create a view CustomerOrderSummary that shows:
----- Customer ID
----- Company Name
----- Total Orders
----- Total Quantity Ordered
----- Total Value of Orders (Quantity * Unit Price)



-- HAVING, GROUP BY:
--- List all products that have been sold more than 500 units in total.

SELECT

--- For each category, show the average unit price of its products. Only include categories with an average price over $20.

  c.category_name,
  ROUND(AVG(p.unit_price),2) AS avg_price
FROM products AS p
JOIN categories AS c

GROUP BY c.category_id, c.category_name
HAVING AVG(unit_price) > 20
ORDER BY avg_price DESC;



-- GETDATE() (or CURRENT_DATE / NOW() in PostgreSQL):
--- Show all orders placed in the last 30 days using NOW() or CURRENT_DATE.



--- Calculate the number of days it took to ship each order (ShippedDate - OrderDate). Label late shipments (>7 days).



-- Primary Key / Foreign Key:
--- Identify all foreign key relationships between these tables:
----- orders, order_details, customers, employees, products, categories, suppliers.

----- Create a diagram or write SQL to show which tables reference products through foreign keys.
